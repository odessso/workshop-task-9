Live Video webcam coding

## Notes:

- Originally, my plan was to make a sort of ripple in the surface of a body of water and have the webcam video feed be the ripple in the pool, however this ended up being SO DIFFICULT. I wanted to replace the blue pixels in a background image and replace the pixels with the blue-tinted pixels of the webcam. Sadly with the knowledge I had I couldn't quite make this happen. Instead, I resorted to applying atleast the code that was working for me and added it to a more square object - a televsion. I originally had an AI generated image of a cave which is why in the code the image is named "cave", it was just taking too long to change all the naming of the code. Anyway, the image I ended up using works better I think.
- adding a greyscale and pixelation made the webcame image integrate with the tv image
- I added some text to give a bit more of a narrative to the code - positioning the text was once again tedious but finally got the gyst of it!

## Problems:
- as always, I had trouble positioning certain elements on the screen. If I had been able to work it out without the code failing I would have made the canvas centred and all the images/webcam video in the centre of the canvas rather than off to the left.
- I tried to use chatGPT to help me make the webcam image more of a parallelogram, however despite it's help the code just wasn't working.
